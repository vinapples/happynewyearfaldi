                <p>thank you, for the way u stayed without ever really being mine HAHAH.
                    for the conversations that felt like home,
                    for the closeness that crossed the line between "temen" and smth more,
                    even when we both knew it wasnt supposed to be like that.
                    aku sempet berharap, i wont lie.
                    not suddenly, not loudly,
                    but slowly, in the comfort, in the routines, in the way you made me feel safe.
                    and maybe thats why letting go hurts more than i expected. we chose to stop because we knew it wasnt healthy,
                    because the past still had a grip on you,
                    and i didnt want to be someone you leaned on while you were still healing :(
                    i deserved clarity, and you deserved space.
                    thank you for the memories that will stay quiet but meaningful.
                    for the almosts, the what-ifs, and the version of us that never got a chance (anjayy). sedih, tapi yaudah gapapa. sekali lagi terimakasih 🤍
                    kangen dikit</p>

                    <p>Edelweiss teaches that love isnt about being loud, its about staying.
                       Bahkan, di tempat paling dingin pun, ia tetap bertahan.
                       Thats why it symbolizes a love thats gentle, rare, and truly enduring.</p>
